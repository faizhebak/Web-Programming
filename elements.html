									<h2>Assignment 1: Report</h2>
									<p>As a second-year student, engaging in this project provided an invaluable opportunity to deepen my understanding of website operations, particularly in terms of their security, performance, and key metrics. Using Google Lighthouse, I evaluated various high-ranking websites from reputable sources like Fortune, Forbes, Statista, QS Ranking, and Alexa. This analysis helped me appreciate the importance of factors such as loading speed, accessibility, SEO, and best practices in delivering a seamless user experience and maintaining high search engine rankings.

										Comparing the performance statistics of these top-tier websites revealed both strengths and areas for improvement. While most sites excelled in performance and SEO, some had notable shortcomings in accessibility. This highlighted the ongoing need for even well-established websites to continuously refine their design and functionality to ensure inclusivity and compliance with industry standards.
										
										Documenting the review process and formulating recommendations for optimization was a challenging yet rewarding experience. It enhanced my technical writing skills and problem-solving abilities, as I suggested improvements like using content delivery networks, enhancing accessibility features, and strengthening security protocols. This project not only provided technical knowledge but also underscored the broader implications of web performance on user satisfaction and business success.

									<h2>Assignment 2: Website</h2>
									<p>As a second-year student, creating a landing page for my personal website using HTML and CSS Grid layout has been an enlightening and transformative experience. This project allowed me to delve deeply into the fundamentals of web development, from structuring HTML content to applying responsive design principles with CSS. By dividing the page into distinct sections—header, content, footer, and navigational menus—I learned the importance of a clear and intuitive layout that enhances user experience and accessibility.

										The process of incorporating a welcoming heading, brand image, and navigational links required me to consider both aesthetic and functional aspects of web design. Ensuring that the content area effectively showcases my accomplishments, hobbies, and personal information involved not just technical skills but also creativity and thoughtful presentation. This exercise helped me understand how design choices impact the overall impression and usability of a website, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that caters to both visual appeal and practical navigation.
										
										Documenting my design choices through internal comments in the HTML and CSS code was particularly beneficial, as it reinforced the rationale behind each element's placement and styling. It also highlighted the importance of clean, well-commented code for maintainability and collaboration. Overall, this project has significantly enhanced my web development skills and provided a solid foundation for future endeavors in creating functional, attractive, and user-friendly websites.

									<h2>Assignment 3: GitHub E-Portfolio</h2>
									<p>The creation of this e-portfolio on GitHub has been a pivotal experience in enhancing my resume-making skills and establishing a professional online presence. GitHub, being a widely recognized platform in the tech industry, serves as a central repository where potential employers and collaborators can assess my technical competencies and project experience. By thoughtfully curating and organizing my work into this e-portfolio, I have learned to present my learning objectives, accomplishments, and talents in a coherent and visually appealing manner that highlights my strengths effectively.

										This project has significantly improved my ability to document and reflect on my educational journey and professional development. Including sections such as personal data, education, job experiences, skills, courses, certificates, honors, awards, and projects has taught me to systematically showcase my achievements and qualifications. Each assignment and project is accompanied by a reflection, summarizing the lessons learned, areas for improvement, and creative insights, which not only demonstrates my capacity for self-assessment but also adds a personal touch to my professional narrative. This reflective practice is invaluable, as it encourages continuous learning and growth.
										
										Furthermore, the process of maintaining an e-portfolio on GitHub has equipped me with essential skills in version control, project management, and collaborative development. By leveraging GitHub's features, I can update my portfolio dynamically, track changes over time, and engage with the broader developer community. This experience has underscored the importance of having a robust and accessible digital portfolio that not only enhances my resume but also serves as a testament to my commitment to excellence and lifelong learning in the field of technology.
